# Get Started
The first thing you should do is download open-css from the GitHub repository. You can choose any release you like, but older ones will most likely not be compatible with this documentation.<br />
<br />
You can download Open-CSS by going to https://github.com/Bismuthium/open-css and going to the releases tab.
