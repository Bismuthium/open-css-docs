# Working with Content

Content is really easy to manage with Open-CSS, kinda like the navbar!<br />
To start off, below your navbar div, make a new div with the class "content". It doesn't do anything, but it's a nice way to seperate your navbar from the content.
```html
<div class="content">

</div>
```
## Containers
Containers are a way to hold pieces of text, in the content div.<br />

Simular to the navbar, the container only is able to natively hold **p** tags. Although you can nest elements in the **p** tag, like before.

:::
```html
<div class="container">
  <p>My text!</p>
</div>
```

Try it for yourself!
