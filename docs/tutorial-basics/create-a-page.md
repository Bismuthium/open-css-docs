# Create a Page

:::info

This tutorial is aiming for **Vanilla HTML** although if you have a basic knowledge of other librarys then it should be easy to follow along.

:::

First of all, to start with Open-CSS, lets create a basic HTML website. You can do this easily by making a folder, then creating an index.html inside of it.<br />
A local server is recommended, you can do this with the **Live Server** VS code extension, or node serve/python simple-http-server.<br />
Let's start off with a Basic HTML page. You can copy this little template into your index.html file, or if your using VS code type an exclamation mark then press enter. They are both the same.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```
After you have downloaded Open-CSS from the github page, import it with a link tag.
```html
<!-- add this to the head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="open-css.css">
```
That's it! You have successfully created a basic HTML page with Open-CSS imported.<br />
