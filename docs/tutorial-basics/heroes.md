# You're a hero (adding heroes)
Heroes are a pretty important part of websites. They pretty much define what a website is about and contain its tagline and a button to navigate to an important- you get it. You can add them the same way you added navbars, and containers, just with the hero class.<br />
You can also use the color classes on heroes.
